I set out on a journey to convert my Linux systems (minus my Steam Deck OLED and ROG Ally X) to NixOS. I started out using my ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9, which is my platform and playground for testing Linux distros.

Here, I will document everything that I have learned throughout this process. From setting up flakes to switching to Home Manager and creating my first module, I have picked up so much knowledge since starting around Christmas 2024.
