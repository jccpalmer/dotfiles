Welcome to my website. My name is JC, a technical writer, freelance technology journalist, and FOSS advocate. This site serves as a central hub for my blog posts, project descriptions, and my documentation (hosted separately).<br />
<br />
If you've landed here, it means that you and I share some kind of common interest. Homelab projects? Mechanical keyboards? General nerding out over FOSS or philosophy? Whatever your reason for stopping by, I'm sure we have something in common. <br />
<br />
The main parts of this site are my [Blog](/blog/) and [Posts](/posts/). The latter will contain relevant write-ups on my past and present projects, plus any reviews that I decided to write. If you're curious to learn more about me, the [About](/about/) page has everything you need to know.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I hope you find something to enjoy here on my website. If anything strikes your fancy and you'd like to know more, feel free to reach out.<br />
<br />
Thanks for stopping by.
