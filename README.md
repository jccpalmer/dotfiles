# Dotfiles configs and settings

This is a repo for my dotfiles. It contains directories for my Neovim setup, my Nix(OS) configs, and my Kitty (potentially Alacritty in the future) settings.

You're free to look through here and see what works for you. I am by no means an expert on any of the configs here since I'm still learning as I go. Suggestions and constructive feedback are welcome.
