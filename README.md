# Dotfiles configs and settings

This is a repo for my dotfiles. It contains directories for my Neovim setup, my Nix Darwin config, and my Kitty / Ghostty settings.

You're free to look through here and see what works for you. I am by no means an expert on any of the configs here since I'm still learning as I go. Suggestions and constructive feedback are welcome.
